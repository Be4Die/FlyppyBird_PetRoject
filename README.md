# Welcome to Flappy Bird!
Hi, this is my first completed pet-project on unity. 
## Content
 - You can reach **records**, which are saved locally.
 - Technically it is possible to change the **bird skins**, but this is not available to the player.
 - **Endless gameplay.**
 - **Sounds** added.
## Technology Stack
 - **Zenject**  for DI.
 - **DooTween** for simple none gameplay animations.
